        The main method of this class. It creates bounds for speed by going through events in Observation, supported by a copy
        of the battle that is played along the original. We look at each segment/chapter of the turn:
        - Switches (triggers from abilities)
        - Tera/Mega/Dynamax
        - Moves (sorted by priorities)
        - Residuals
        - Switches from fainted mons (and triggers from abilities)

        We store each order we observe and the associated multiplier of speed based on the current battle conditions. We turn each
        of these "orders" into a set of equations that we solve to minimize and maximize opponent stats to get the mons' stat ranges.
        We store these in the flags we share with BattleInference. This means this method can get speed inferences wrong if they
        could make sense when there's actually a choicescarf

        Right now, we assume abilities that affect speeds/priorities, we don't look at every interaction of moves, and only try to
        learn choice scarfs (not iron ball or lagging tail).
