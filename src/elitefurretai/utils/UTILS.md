# Utils

This folder contains general utilities for EliteFurretAI. So far, these include:
1. **MetaDB**: a module that calls a database built on raw data (dependent on anonymized showdown data availability) that will allow us to make usage-based inferences (e.g. likelihood that Incineroar has assault vest | observations). The database will not be sharable. `predict_vgc_team` will take in what the AI has observed about the opponent's pokemon (stored in `ObservedPokemon`) and return either the most common team that matches your observations, or a probability distribution of all teams that matches its observations based on data stored in the database. The probability distributions can then be used for probabilistic search for AI; the primary downside is that this method relies on having previously seen data -- it only memorizes. I have not yet tested this method's coverage.
2. **BattleOrderValidator**: This module simply validates which moves are available moves we should pick from. It has simple logic that first validates whether a move will even work. Note that this is _not_ representative of what will pass the showdown protocol -- it is a stricter protocol syntax (relative to what Showdown accepts) that we will force the AI to use.
   - It separately contains simple heuristics that eliminate moves that are unlikely to help (e.g. self-attacks if the move doesnt heal or activate weakness policy).
3. [**TeamRepo**](#3-teamrepo): This module simply just retrieves several pre-built teams to use, stored in data/teams

For `MetaDB`, the database is structured as follows:

| battle | team | pokemon | team_counts |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| battle_id (key) | team_id | mon_id (key) | team_id |
| player1  | mon_id | species | format |
| player2  | | gender | num |
| elo1  | | tera_type |  |
| elo2  | | item |  |
| team1_id  | | hp |  |
| team2_id  | | atk |  |
| sent_team1_id  | | def |  |
| sent_team2_id  | | spa |  |
| result  | | spd |  |
| score  | | spe |  |
| format | | ability |  |
| | | level |  |
| | | shiny |  |
| | | move1_id |  |
| | | move2_id |  |
| | | move3_id |  |
| | | move3_id |  |

# 3. TeamRepo

This module provides functionality for reading and managing Pokémon teams in Showdown Export ([PokePaste](https://pokepast.es/syntax.html)) format. It includes features for team validation and organization.

## Features

- Read teams from a specified directory structure
- Optional team validation using [Pokémon Showdown](https://github.com/smogon/pokemon-showdown)
- Organize teams by format
- Retrieve individual teams or all teams for a specific format

## Usage

### Initializing TeamRepo

```python
from team_repo import TeamRepo

repo = TeamRepo(
    filepath="path/to/team/directory",
    showdown_path="path/to/pokemon-showdown",
    validate=False,
    verbose=False
)
```

### Parameters

- `filepath`: Path to the directory containing team files (default: "data/teams")
- `showdown_path`: Path to the Pokémon Showdown directory (default: "../pokemon-showdown")
- `validate`: Whether to validate teams using Pokémon Showdown (default: False)
- `verbose`: Whether to print verbose output (default: False)

### Accessing Teams

```python
# Get all formats
formats = repo.formats

# Get all teams for a specific format
gen8ou_teams = repo.get_all("vgc2023regd")

# Get a specific team
team = repo.get("vgc2023regd", "team_name")

# Get all teams for all formats
all_teams = repo.teams
```

### Team Validation

If `validate=True` is set when initializing TeamRepo, it will attempt to validate each team using Pokémon Showdown. Make sure you have Pokémon Showdown and that `showdown_path` is correctly set for this feature to work.

## File Structure

The module expects teams to be organized in the following directory structure:

```
data/teams/
    ├── vgc2023regd/
    │   ├── team1.txt
    │   └── team2.txt
    ├── vgc2024regg/
    │   ├── team3.txt
    │   └── team4.txt
    └── ...
```

Each `.txt` file should contain a single team in Showdown Export format.
